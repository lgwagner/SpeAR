Specification thermostat

Types:
	heater_operating_state: enum {ON, OFF, ERROR}

Constants:
	TIMEOUT : int = 10
  
Inputs:
  ambient is a real
  target  is a real
  
Outputs:
  heater_command is a heater_operating_state
  
State:
 timer : int
 
Assumptions:
 a0: previous heater_command equal to ON implies
		ambient greater than or equal to previous ambient
			
Requirements:
 r0: if ambient less than target and
			timer less than or equal to TIMEOUT then
		heater_command equal to ON
 r1: if ambient greater than or equal to target and
			timer less than or equal to TIMEOUT then
		heater_command equal to OFF
 r2: if timer greater than TIMEOUT then
			heater_command equal to ERROR
 r3: timer equal to previous(timer) + 1

Properties:
 p_heat: if heater_command equal to ON then
			ambient less than target
 p_off: 	if heater_command equal to OFF then
			ambient greater than or equal to target
 p_error: if heater_command equal to ERROR then
			timer greater than TIMEOUT
 p_elatch: once heater_command equal to ERROR
			implies heater_command equal to ERROR
