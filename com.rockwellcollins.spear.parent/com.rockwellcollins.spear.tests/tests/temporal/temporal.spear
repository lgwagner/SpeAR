Specification temporal

Types:
	state_type : enum {A,B,Y,Z}

Inputs:
	a : bool

Outputs:
	state : state_type

State:

Macros:
	pre_state : state_type = previous state with initial value A

Assumptions:

Requirements:
	r0: initially (state == A)
	r1: (pre_state == A) and a implies (state == B)
	r2: (pre_state == B) and a implies (state == Y)
	r3: (pre_state == Y) and a implies (state == Z)
	r4: (pre_state == Z) implies (state == Z)
	r5: not a implies (state == pre_state)

Behaviors:
	p0: once (state == B) implies (state <> A)
	p1: once (state == Y) implies (state <> A) and (state <> B)
	p2: once (state == Z) implies (state <> A) and (state <> B) and (state <> Y)
	p3 observe: (state == Z)
