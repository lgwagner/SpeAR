Specification unit_validation

Units:
  m "meters"  
  
Types:
  length_type is a real m

Inputs:
  x is a length_type
  
Outputs:
  y is a length_type
  z is a length_type
  w is a length_type

Requirements:
  r_should_fail_validation1:
    y == previous x + 1.0
    
  r_should_fail_validation2:
    if x == 1.0 m then
      y == 1.0 m
    else if previous x == 2.0 then y == 2.0
    else if previous x == 3.0 then y == 3.0
      
  r_should_fail_validation3:
    y == 1.0 m and
    z == previous x + 1.0 and w == 2.0
    
  r_does_fail_validation1:
    w == (previous x with initial value 0.0 m) + 1.0

  r_does_fail_validation2:
    z == x + 1.0
