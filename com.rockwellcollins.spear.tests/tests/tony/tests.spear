Specification tests

Types:
  state is an enum {A, B, C}

Inputs:
  
Outputs:

State:
  s is a state
  t is an int
  p_t is an int

Requirements:
  i1: p_t equal to previous t with initial value 0
  r4: t equal to p_t + 1

  r1: while t <  5 then s equal to A
  r2: while t == 5 then s equal to B
  r3: while t >  5 then s equal to C
  
Properties:
  p1: before (t > 5) implies once (s equal to A)
  p2: once t == 5 implies once s equal to B
  p3: once t == 5 implies once s equal to A
  
  p4: after t==5 implies once (s equal to B)
  p5: after t==5 until t==6 implies (s equal to B)
  p6: after t>5 implies not ((s equal to A) or (s equal to B))
  
  p7: after t>=5 implies once (s equal to B) and once (s equal to A)
  p8: after t>5 implies once (s equal to B) and once (s equal to A) and (s equal to C)
  
  p9: once (s == A)
