Specification after_before

Constants:
	TOP_VAL is a real = 3.0
	INIT_VAL is a real = 0.0

Inputs:
	in_value is a real

Outputs:
	out_bnd_value is a real
	over_sig is a bool

Macros:
	next_val is a real = in_value + previous out_bnd_value with initial value INIT_VAL
	
	bnd_val is a real = if next_val < 0.0 then 0.0
						else if next_val > TOP_VAL then TOP_VAL
						else next_val

Assumptions:
	a01a: in_value greater than or equal to 0.0
//	a01b = in_value greater than 0.0
	
	a02a: in_value less than or equal to 0.2
//	a02b = in_value less than or equal to 1.0
//	a02c = in_value less than or equal to 1.2

DerivedRequirements:
	dr_after: after next_val greater than TOP_VAL implies over_sig equal to TRUE
		
	dr_before: before next_val greater than TOP_VAL implies over_sig equal to FALSE
	
	dr_init: initially out_bnd_value equal to 0.0
	
	dr_output: out_bnd_value equal to bnd_val


Requirements:
	/* Counter-examples should both fail */
	r_CE_01: not over_sig
	r_CE_02: over_sig 
	
//	r_CE_03 = in_value greater than 0.0
	canary: false
